# X to Y extension

_Replace words and links_

![icon][icon]

Ever think it would be funny to replace a word with another? Sick and tired of a website deadnaming you? You are going to enjoy X to Y!

X to Y supports plain text, regex, and urls.

- To do regex just type regex (`/pattern/flags`) in the X field
- To replace links, just check the `Link Mode` checkbox
